# ICT Retracement to Order Block with Screener

This Pine Script indicator identifies potential retracements to order blocks and includes a screener to scan multiple symbols.  It's based on ICT (Inner Circle Trader) concepts, but due to scripting limitations, it implements core ideas rather than a strict 100% adherence to all ICT rules.

**Disclaimer:** This indicator is for informational and educational purposes only. It should not be considered financial advice.  Trading involves substantial risk, and you could lose money.  Use this indicator at your own discretion and always perform your own due diligence before making any trading decisions. The author does not guarantee the accuracy or reliability of the signals generated by this indicator.

## Features

* **Order Block Identification:** Detects potential order blocks based on price action and momentum.
* **Retracement Signals:** Identifies potential retracement points to the order block.
* **Screener:** Scans up to 40 symbols for order block setups.
* **Customizable Inputs:**  Adjustable period, vertical offset, colors, line style, and more.
* **Alerts:** Visual alerts on the chart for primary, secondary, and tertiary signals.
* **Table Display:**  Shows screener results in a sortable table.

## How to Use

1. **Add to Chart:** Add the script to your TradingView chart.
2. **Configure Inputs:** Adjust the input parameters as needed:
    * **Period:** The number of candles used to determine the highest high and lowest low.  The default of 30 is optimized for 15m and 1h charts but can be adjusted for other timeframes.
    * **Vertical Offset (%):**  A buffer around the order block level.  A value of 0 means the retracement needs to touch the order block precisely.  A higher value creates a buffer.
    * **Symbols:** A comma-separated list of symbols to scan in the screener (e.g., `NSE:ABCAPITAL,NSE:ANANTRAJ,...`).  **Limit: 40 symbols.**
    * **Direction (Screener):** Filter screener results for "Bullish," "Bearish," or "Both" setups.
    * **Only Bullish/Bearish (Screener):** Show only bullish or bearish signals in the screener table.
    * **Display Rows (Screener):** The number of rows to display in the screener table.
    * **Table Position/Size:** Customize the screener table's appearance.
    * **Line Settings:** Adjust the style and width of the alert lines.
    * **Colors:** Customize the colors for bullish, bearish, and neutral signals.
3. **Interpret Signals:**
    * **Signal 1:** Identifies the order block candle.
    * **Signal 2:** Indicates a momentum move away from the order block.
    * **Signal 3:** Marks the retracement back to the order block level.
4. **Use the Screener:** The screener table will display symbols that meet the defined criteria.  Remember that the screener doesn't determine the overall trend, so additional analysis is required.
5. **Multi-Timeframe Analysis:** Use multiple timeframes (e.g., 1H, 15M, 5M for intraday) to confirm the trend and refine entries.

## Order Block Concept (Brief Overview)

An order block is often identified as the last bullish or bearish candle before a significant price move.  The indicator looks for candles that break a recent high or low and then retraces to that level.  This retracement to the order block can be a potential entry point.  **It is highly recommended to study ICT's teachings on order blocks for a deeper understanding.**

## Screener Limitations

* **Symbol Limit:** The screener is limited to 40 symbols due to TradingView's character limits for input fields.
* **No Trend Identification:** The screener does not automatically determine the trend.  You must analyze the trend yourself.
* **Potential for Inaccurate Results:** The screener and the indicator may produce inaccurate results.  Always confirm signals with your own analysis.
